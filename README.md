# GymStatusInfo
Project for an informing website about gyms, according to the current refugee situation in Germany. Especially in south Germany.

## Development

To start developing on this website, you need to install node.js on your machine.
If node is already installed, change to the directory of this repository and run

```
npm install
```

to install all the dependencies.

To start developing, run
